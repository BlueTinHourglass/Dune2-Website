                    <h3>Planet Information</h3>
                    <p>Caladan, home planet of the Atreides, has a warm, calm climate and the lands are lush and green. The rich soils and mild weather support an extensive variety of agricultural activities. In recent centuries industrial and technological development has added to the prosperity of the Caladanian peoples.</p>

                <h3>House Profile</h3>
                <p>
                House Atreides has been prominent for thousands of years and has a long tradition of being fai and just administrators. Their people are loyal, hard working and peace-able. Both intelligent and noble, the Atreides leaders have endeared themselves to their subjects. Unusual devotion to duty is a common feature among the Atreides soldiers. According to all recent reports, the Atreides military is in top operating condition, as are their vehicles and structures.
                </p>
                <p>Our sources indicate that the Atreides campaign on Dune is being advised by the brillian Mentat Cyril. As expected, the Atreides have been passive and have not attacked the other Houses to date, although they have successfully defended themselves against a series of raids, abotage, and larger offensives. True to their nature, the Atreides have attempted to achieve their goals through diplomacy, a strategy which will undoubtedly fail on Dune.</p>

                </figure>
                <h3>Planet Information</h3>
                <p>From the dark world of Geidi Prime the terrible House Harkonnen has spread across the universe. A cruel people, we can expect the Harkonnen to be ruthless towards both friend and foe in their pursuit of control of Dune.</p>

                <h3>House Profile</h3>
                <p>House Harkonnen is the most savage House in the universe. The Harkonnens have a long history of employing violence and fear to achieve their objectives. Status is not bestowed in House Harkonnen, it is taken. If a subordinate kills a superior, he assumes that position and is respected. Their military organisation changes constantly and is almost impossible to follow.</p>
                <p>Our current reports on House Harkonnen indicate their Dune strategies are being dictated by the unstable Mentat, Radnor. A true Harkonnen, Radnor reached his position by assassinating the previous Mentat Marko, his former teacher and guide. We do not know the extent to which Radnor is trusted by his people or the House he serves. The Harkonnes on Dune have spent most of their efforts assembling a considerable military force. We doubt they plan to actually harvest spice for the Emporer. They seem convinced that they can merely conquer the other Houses. The combination of Radnor's lust for power and his ability to persuade is dangerous. We shall continue to monitor the Harkonnens closely, for they are quite unpredictable.</p>

                    </figure>
                <h3>Planet Information</h3>
                <p>The home planet of the Ordos is a frigid and ice-covered world. We presume the Ordos import their agricultural and technological goods from nearby star systems. Acting as traders and brokers, the Ordos produce no physical product of their own and rely upon their merchandising skills to survive.</p>

                </figure>
                <h3>House Profile</h3>
                <p>Our sources indicate the House Ordos represents a cartel of wealthy families, brought together by the desire for greater security. The Ordos have little conscience and seem to gain strength through their sabotage and terrorism. Protected by their great wealth, the Ordos' status as a great House is unaffected by their long history of manipulation, trickery, and deception.</p>
                <p>Recent reports suggest the cunning Mentat, Ammon, is in charge of Ordos' Dune operations. This is a rare opportunity to get a clear view of Ammon in action. It will be interesting to learn more about these clandestine peoples.</p>
